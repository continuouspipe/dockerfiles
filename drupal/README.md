# Drupal with Apache and PHP

In a Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/continuouspipe/drupal-php7.1-apache:stable
ARG GITHUB_TOKEN=

COPY . /app
RUN container build
```

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/continuouspipe/drupal-php7-apache:stable
ARG GITHUB_TOKEN=

COPY . /app
RUN container build
```

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/continuouspipe/drupal-php5.6-apache:stable
ARG GITHUB_TOKEN=

COPY . /app
RUN container build
```

## How to build
```bash
docker-compose build drupal_php71_apache drupal_php70_apache drupal_php56_apache
docker-compose push drupal_php71_apache drupal_php70_apache drupal_php56_apache
```

## About

This is a Docker image that can support a Drupal 7 or 8 installation, running on Apache with PHP 5.6/7.0/7.1, depending 
on the image chosen.

## How to use

As for all images based on the ubuntu base image, see
[the base image README](../../ubuntu/16.04/README.md)

To finish the installation after basing your image off of this one, assuming you are using docker compose, please run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d database
GITHUB_TOKEN="<your github token>" docker-compose run web container setup
```

You can influence the installation process by placing functions in `/usr/local/share/container/plan.sh`
that extend or replace the functions found in `/usr/local/share/drupal/drupal_functions.sh`

### Custom build and startup scripts

To run commands during the build and startup sequences that the base images add,
please add `usr/local/share/container/plan.sh` for a project, or
`usr/local/share/container/baseimage-{number}.sh` if creating another base image.

This allows you to define and override bash functions that the base images add.

In addition to the bash functions defined in this base image's parent images:
[the base image functions](../../ubuntu/16.04/README.md#custom-build-and-startup-scripts)
[the php-apache image functions](../../php/apache/README.md#custom-build-and-startup-scripts)

This base image adds the following bash functions:

function | description | executed on
--- | --- | --- |
do_drupal8_install | Builds Drupal | do_build 
do_drupal8_development_start | Installs Drupal | do_development_start  

These functions can be triggered via the /usr/local/bin/container command, dropping off the "do_" part. e.g:

````
/usr/local/bin/container build # runs do_build
/usr/local/bin/container start_supervisord # runs do_start_supervisord
````
