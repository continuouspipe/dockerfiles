# Ubuntu Base

In a Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/continuouspipe/ubuntu16.04:stable

COPY ./somedir /somedir

RUN container build
```

In a docker-compose.yml:
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  ubuntu:
    image: quay.io/continuouspipe/ubuntu16.04:stable
```

## How to build
```bash
docker build --pull --tag quay.io/continuouspipe/ubuntu16.04:stable --rm .
docker push
```

or:

```bash
docker-compose build ubuntu
docker-compose push ubuntu
```

## About

This is a Docker image that tracks the upstream library ubuntu image releases It also installs
common tooling for usage of the ContinuousPipe development environment tool, "cp-remote", as well
as providing a solid foundation for the rest of the base images in this repository.

## How to use

The `etc` and `usr` folders local to this README get copied into the image. That means we can influence any file in
`etc` or `usr` using Docker's layering filesystem.

Upon starting a container made from this image, `/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/container start_supervisord` will run. This will:

1. Include environment variable definitions from /usr/local/share/env/
2. Optionally create a user and group to match the given file or directory on a mountpoint.
3. Run `confd` to render templates with environment variables.
4. Run any custom tasks in /usr/local/bin/supervisor_custom_start
5. Run supervisord to start services

### Technical details of how supervisord gets started

1. Read in function definitions from:
 1.1. /usr/local/share/bootstrap/setup.sh
 1.2. /usr/local/share/bootstrap/common_functions.sh
2. Run "load_env()", which will include environment variable definitions from /usr/local/share/env/*, in alphanumerical order.
3. Read in function definitions from:
 3.1. /usr/local/share/container/baseimage-*.sh, in alphanumerical order.
 3.2. /usr/local/share/container/plan.sh
4. Execute the function "do_start_supervisord()", which will run "do_start()" and "do_supervisord()"

### SupervisorD

We are using supervisord to control service startup and provide a way to handle zombie processes gracefully,
with supervisord becoming PID 1.

You can start any service you want by adding a config file into the `/etc/supervisor/conf.d` folder.
For example, to start NGINX, place the following in `etc/supervisor/conf.d/nginx.conf`:

```
[program:nginx]
command = /usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon off;'
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
user = root
autostart = true
autorestart = true
priority = 10
```

### ConfD

[ConfD](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd) is in use to provide templating support for configuration files.

ConfD is automatically run when an image starts, and crucially, it is run before anything else. That means you can
have an optional SupervisorD service like so, in `etc/confd/templates/supervisor/nginx.conf.tmpl`:

```
[program:nginx]
command = /usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon off;'
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
stderr_logfile=/dev/stderr
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0
user = root
autostart = {{ getenv "START_NGINX" }}
autorestart = true
priority = 10
```

This is backed up by the confd configuration file: `etc/confd/conf.d/supervisor_nginx.conf.toml`:

```
[template]
src   = "supervisor/nginx.conf.tmpl"
dest  = "/etc/supervisord/conf.d/nginx.conf"
mode  = "0644"
keys = [
]
```

### Build user

The Docker image creates a utility user named "build". Images that base themselves on this image
can use the "build" user for installation processes that should not be run as root.

### Default Environment Variables

To define default environment variables for confd to use when rendering templates, place an export line in
a file in `usr/local/share/env/`.

#### How to declare variables

Here's an example from the php-apache image in this repository:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

export PHP_TIMEZONE=${PHP_TIMEZONE:-UTC}
export PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=${PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT:-256M}
export APP_USER=${APP_USER:-www-data}
export APP_GROUP=${APP_GROUP:-www-data}
export START_NGINX=${START_NGINX:-false}
export START_PHP_FPM=${START_PHP_FPM:-false}
```

The repetition of the variable name inside ${} is to allow the passing through of a value that has already been defined beforehand.

For Docker, variables can be passed in by docker-compose.yml, the Dockerfile, or from the command line. ContinuousPipe can declare variables in the continuous-pipe.yml or any of the other Docker locations.

The default which is after the ":-" will be used if no value for the variable name has been given.

##### Debugging variables

You can use the shell function from common_functions.sh to access a bash session which has all the environment variables declared.
To do so, run the following:
```bash
container shell -c 'env'
```
Or if you run `container shell` by itself then you can stay in the session.

#### How to name your variables file

The files in the env folder are evaluated in alpha-numerical order, meaning the same order as when you list them in the directory.
This means that the lowest number will be read first. To ensure that project specific environment
variables override the defaults defined in the base images, define them in a
`usr/local/share/env/20-project` file, which would be read before a `usr/local/share/env/30-framework` file.

The naming convention for environment files that is used in these base images is:

* "20-project" for images that are used for your project
* "30-framework" for images that provide framework-specific functionality like the PHP frameworks Symfony, Magento or Drupal
* "40-stack" for images that provide infrastructure like web servers such as NGINX or Apache

#### Variables defined by this image

The following variables are supported

Variable | Description | Expected values | Default
--- | --- | --- | ----
WORK_DIRECTORY | The directory that most commands should run in, ideally the location of the codebase being deployed. | string | /app
CODE_OWNER | The user who should own the code located in WORK_DIRECTORY. | username (string) | build
CODE_GROUP | The group who should own the code located in WORK_DIRECTORY | group name (string) | build
START_CRON | Should the cron daemon be started when starting the container up? | true/false | false
DEVELOPMENT_MODE | Control whether do_development_start() is triggered, which will repeat actions. | true/false | Defaults to true if WORK_DIRECTORY is detected as a mountpoint.
APP_USER_LOCAL | Control if [Volume Permission Fixes](#Volume Permission Fixes) is performed, which will set up APP_USER, APP_GROUP, CODE_OWNER and CODE_GROUP as usernames/group names that match the permissions of the WORK_DIRECTORY mountpoint | true/false | Defaults to true if WORK_DIRECTORY is detected as a mountpoint that doesn't allow "chown" or permission operations
APP_USER_LOCAL_RANDOM | If [Volume Permission Fixes](#Volume Permission Fixes) is performed, generate a random username and group name. | true/false | false
BUILD_USER_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY | The base64 encoded private key that should be set up on the build user. See [SSH Keys](#SSH Key) for more details. | base64 encoded string | empty
BUILD_USER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY | The base64 encoded public key that should be set up on the build user. See [SSH Keys](#SSH Key) for more details. | base64 encoded string | empty
BUILD_USER_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS | The base64 encoded known hosts file that should be set up on the build user. See [SSH Keys](#SSH Key) for more details. | base64 encoded string | empty
RUN_BUILD | Whether to run build tasks. This includes whether do_development_start is called | true/false | true

### Volume Permission Fixes

Using the function `do_update_permissions()`, we can create a user and group that matches up with
the user and group of the file/directory referenced by `WORK_DIRECTORY` which is `/app` by default.

This will only be done if the value of `APP_USER_LOCAL` is `true`.

After creating the user/group, the APP_USER and APP_GROUP environment variables will be exported, allowing `confd` to
pick up on these for use in templates.

Please note that running services as this randomly created user/group could cause a security risk. For instance in the
case of a web server, running the web server process with the same user or group as the code could let an attacker
alter any file in the codebase.

As such, only set APP_USER_LOCAL in development when using volumes.

### SSH Key

The docker images support configuring an SSH key for the "build" user, which is the user that should be running installation tools.

Assuming you have generated a passwordless SSH keypair on your machine (ideally this would be a keypair especially for use in the docker setup, rather than your own), you can do the following to provide the keypair to this docker image:

* `BUILD_USER_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` is the output of `base64 <PRIVATE_KEY_FILEPATH>`
* `BUILD_USER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` is the output of `base64 <PUBLIC_KEY_FILEPATH>`
* `BUILD_USER_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` is the output of `ssh-keyscan -H -t rsa,ecdsa <HOSTNAME_TO_CONNECT_TO> | base64`, where HOSTNAME_TO_CONNECT_TO is for example github.com or bitbucket.org or any other server.

### Custom build and startup scripts

To run commands during the build and startup sequences that the base images add,
please add `/app/plan.sh` for a project, or
`usr/local/share/container/baseimage-{number}.sh` if creating another base image.

This allows you to define and override bash functions that the base images add.

This base image adds the following bash functions:

function | description | executed on
--- | --- | ---
do_build | By default does nothing in this image, but is intended to perform installation steps where no external services such as databases are required. | manual trigger
do_migrate | By default does nothing in this image, but is intended to perform deployment steps run only once per deployment that need an external service, e.g. database migrations, cache flushes/warming | manual trigger
do_start_supervisord | Runs do_start and do_supervisord | manual trigger
do_supervisord | Runs [supervisord](#SupervisorD) | do_start_supervisor
do_setup | By default does nothing in this image, but is intended to perform installation steps on first deployment only that need an external service. | manual trigger
do_start | Runs all of the bash functions defined below | do_start_supervisor
do_update_permissions | Runs the [Volume Permission Fixes](#Volume Permission Fixes) | do_start
check_development_start | Triggers "do_development_start" if "DEVELOPMENT_MODE" is set to true | do_start
do_templating | Runs [confd](#ConfD) | do_start
do_development_start | By default does nothing in this image, but is intended to repeat certain actions like "do_build()" if a mountpoint has overwritten what the image build did. | check_development_start

These functions can be triggered via the /usr/local/bin/container command, dropping off the "do_" part. e.g:

/usr/local/bin/container build # runs do_build
/usr/local/bin/container start_supervisord # runs do_start_supervisord
